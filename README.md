frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game
===============================

This is my interpretation of the classic frogger for the fewd nanodegree.

# Whats inside?

## The game
How to play? Use the arrow keys for up, down, left and right. Avoid any contact with the bugs, bugs are bad...

## a serviceworker for offline madness

## and a manifest.json for installing the game (not yet fully implemented)

### very important, the css is bigger, because it is copies from my site www.art-by-pixel.de

# have fun!;-)
