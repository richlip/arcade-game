frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game
===============================

This is my interpretation of the classic frogger for the fewd nanodegree.

# Whats inside?
The folder holds inside the index.html, the css file in it's own folder as well as the app.js, even in it's own folder.
To play the game, download the whole folder and start the index.html.

## The game
How to play? Use the arrow keys for up, down, left and right. Avoid any contact with the bugs, bugs are bad...

## a serviceworker for offline madness

## and a manifest.json for installing the game (not yet fully implemented)

### very important, the css is bigger, because it is copies from my site www.art-by-pixel.de

# have fun!;-)
